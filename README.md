Simple Linear Regression Project: A Look Back
Overview
This project was one of my first steps into data science, done years ago. I used Simple Linear Regression to see how sales related to advertising for a diet product. It was simple but taught me a lot about the basics.

About Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a basic but powerful tool in data science. It shows how one thing affects another. In this project, I looked at how spending on ads could change sales numbers.

Simple Linear Regression
This project focused on Simple Linear Regression, which means I only looked at two things: sales and advertising. It's a straightforward way to understand how one thing can predict another.

Why This Project Matters
Even though it was basic, this project was important for learning. It helped me understand how data science can find patterns in real-world situations.
